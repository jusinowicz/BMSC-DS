## R Analyses
This folder contains the raster layers produced by the main R code and current map projects. It also contains the SQLite database which is written to by **presence_absence_SDM_popdyn.R** and contains all of the layers. QGIS can connect directly to this database because it is a SpatiaLite databse. 

Key output includes: 

1. Calvo_**_2021: The current QGIS project. 
2. Daphnia_ESRI_base.qpt: Layout showing distributions with competititve impactive, ESRI map base. Rasters (.tif) that are saved in the QGIS folder to produce prettier maps.
3. Daphnia_OSM_base.qpt: Layout showing distributions with competititve impactive, OSM standard map base. 
4. PDF files which are just the exported versions of the .qpt files
