## Overview
This repository contains code and data supporting the development of a joint Species Distribution Modeling (SDM) and Population Dynamics (PD) for forecasting future distributions of Daphnia species throughout British Columbia (BC) and Canada. 

The structure of this repository is as follows: 
**R_analysis**: This is where the core of the analysis code is stored. Current working code is in the main repository. See the "old_code" dir for files that either were or are in development. 
This folder also contains a Jupyter notebook file that walks through the analysis.
This folder also contains a SQLite database with the final species distriubtions in .TIF format. This can be accessed by downloading the file, or connecting remotely. 

**QGIS**: This is where we have stored the nicer maps of distributions in QGIS. It includes the raw TIFs generated by R_analysis, as well as QGIS project files. 
This folder also contains a SQLite database with the final species distriubtions in .TIF format. This can be accessed by downloading the file, or connecting remotely. 

**output**: Folder to contain output generated by the R files. This excludes many figures and several data sets. 

**data**: This is stored data that is necessary as input to the R analysis files. 

**docs**: Miscellaneous things, including some papers and data sets taken from papers.
